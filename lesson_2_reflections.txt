What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we intialize a repository, a new git repository is created but none of the files in the directory which the repository is created are not committed.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is an area which is is a temporary area between the working directory and the repository. All the changes or files that need to be commited are moved to the staging first before committing to the repository. This is useful because it helps us review the files and changes and make any last minute changes before committing to the repository.
